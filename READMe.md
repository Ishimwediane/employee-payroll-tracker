##  How It Works

### Adding Employees

When adding an employee, you'll be prompted for:

- **Employee Type**: FullTime, Contract, or Intern
- **Name**: Employee's full name (required)
- **Department**: Department they belong to
- **Position**: Job title or role
- **Salary Details**:
  - **Full-Time**: Monthly salary
  - **Contract**: Hourly rate and hours worked
  - **Intern**: Monthly stipend
- **Bonus** (optional): Additional compensation

### Salary Calculation

- **Full-Time Employee**: `Total = Monthly Salary + Bonus`
- **Contract Employee**: `Total = (Hours Worked × Hourly Rate) + Bonus`
- **Intern**: `Total = Stipend + Bonus` (tax-free if stipend ≤ 30,000 RWF)

### Tax Calculation (Rwanda Example)

- Progressive tax applied only to salary/stipend, **not bonus**
- Interns below 30,000 RWF are tax-exempt
- Contract and Full-Time employees always pay tax on salary

### Net Salary

```
Net Salary = Total Salary - Tax
```
